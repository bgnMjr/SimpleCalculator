# SimpleCalculator
A simple commandline calculator, written in Java.
It uses two classes Main and Menu. 
The Main is the point of entry. At its base, it uses a while-loop. Thanks to the Scanner object, the programm waits for the user input instead looping infinetely. Inputting 'exit' is the way to break the loop.
Menu provides the command-line messages and does the actual (simple) calculating.

At this point the calculator performs operations with integral numbers.

A simple error catching is implemented. It provides a general error Message.
